            <p>This is the valorant buy menu. It consists of 8 sections. All the way to the left is the side arm column where players can purchase a cheap but not so efficient handgun. It offers a variety of different weapons like a revolver, mini SMG, double barrel shotgun, etc. To the right of this column is the SMGs and Shotguns. It includes two smgs and two shotguns between 900 -1600 credits. The to the right of that is the rifles. Anything from a burst rifle to an AK. These guns are the most popular and used the most by pros. Next are the snipers and heavy weapons. Snipers are very self explanatory and the heavy weapons are machine guns with maximum recoil. All the way to the right is the shield section where plays can buy extra shield to give them more health and are able to take more bullets. Lastly, all the way to the bottom is the ability section where players can buy and sell abilities that they need or donâ€™t need.</p>
